										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>I'm Liv, and I'm a Tools Engineer specialised in building, maintaining, and improving bespoke toolsets. I am driven by my passion for games and my belief that games are the greatest form of entertainment, education, and connection in the modern world. I love the raw, problem-solving nature of tooling development, as well as the variety of work it provides, and the ability to collaborate closely with all artists, designers, and content creators.</p>

									<h3>Tools Engineer - Playground Games</h3>
									<h4><i>07/19 - Present</i></h4>
									<p>At Playground Games, I work as a Tools Engineer on the Forza Team. My role involves the user-driven development of improvements and new features for Playground Gamesâ€™ proprietary AAA toolset, working on an enormous variety of tools and workflows. These include systems for Bezier curves, game asset setup/management, and the authoring and build pipeline tooling for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjZ5nPwCCOk">procedural world generation system</a>. Alongside this, I work with our UX designer to provide huge UI/UX overhauls for the toolset, and run masterclasses and 1:1 sessions with the team, training them how to create better tooling from the outset.</p>
                                    <p>To accomplish all of this, I work closely with our world-class artists, designers, and content creators to create, refine, improve, and redesign their immense variety of workflows. I enjoy listening to them carefully, watching them work, and collaboratively reaching the best solution. Furthermore, I have long-time involvement in interviews for potential new employees, and I have attended multiple recruitment and outreach events on behalf of Playground Games to encourage more job applicants. Beyond my role, I am part of several after work clubs, as well as company resource groups for women, and for members of the LGBTQ+ community, pushing for greater inclusivity in the industry.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Interests</h2>
									<p>As a game programmer, I naturally spend much of my spare time playing games, and I am looking forward to the latest instalment Life is Strange - Double Exposure.  In the meantime, I have been feeding my long-term obsession with Baldur's Gate 3 and exploring all the different story paths within it.  My favourite game of all time is Civilization V.  I think the reason for this (other than how infinitely replayable it is) is the same reason that strategy games are my favourite genre of game to play; they provide a social platform that can either be full of tension at the forefront of conversation, or in the background while other conversations happen, entirely depending on wishes of the group.</p>
									<p>Aside from games, I have been playing the piano for over 10 years and the guitar for 1 year. Music serves as the perfect way for me to relax and unwind on the evening.  To keep fit, I also play football and go bouldering weekly with both friends and colleagues.</p>
