										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>I am Olivia, also known as Liv, and I am a Tools Engineer specialised in building, maintaining, and improving bespoke toolsets. I am driven by my passion for games and my belief that games are the greatest form of entertainment, education, and connection in the modern world. I love the raw, problem-solving nature of tooling development, as well as the variety of work it provides, and the ability to collaborate closely with all artists, designers, and content creators. I take great satisfaction in listening to people, watching their workflows, and finding ways to refine and improve their daily lives.</p>

									<h3>Tools Engineer - Playground Games</h3>
									<h4><i>07/19 - Present</i></h4>
									<p>At Playground Games, I work as a Tools Engineer on the Forza Team.  My role involves the user-driven development of improvements and new features for Playground Games’ proprietary AAA toolset.  Day-to-day I work closely with world-class artists, designers, and content creators to create, refine, improve, and redesign an immense variety of workflows.  I enjoy listening to them carefully, watching them work, and collaboratively reaching the best solution.  Doing this, I have learned the importance of communication throughout development, in addition to the importance of stability – leading me to use test-driven development frequently in my work.  Furthermore, I have recently started getting involved in interviews for potential new employees, and I have attended multiple recruitment and outreach events on behalf of Playground Games to encourage more job applicants.  Beyond my role, I am part of company resource groups for women, and for members of the LGBTQ+ community, pushing for greater inclusivity in the industry.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Interests</h2>
									<p>As a game programmer, I naturally spend much of my spare time playing games, and I am looking forward to the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor release in 2023.  In the meantime, I have been playing Pokémon Violet, and loving all the nostalgia that comes with it.  Friends and colleagues have also started playing, and the multiplayer and social aspects have been very enjoyable.  My favourite game of all time is Civilization V.  I think the reason for this (other than how infinitely replayable it is) is the same reason that strategy games are my favourite genre of game to play; they provide a social platform that can either be full of tension at the forefront of conversation, or in the background while other conversations happen, entirely depending on wishes of the group.</p>
									<p>Aside from games, I have been playing the piano for over 10 years, learning everything from Mozart to the theme tune of Skyrim.  I find music a delightful way to relax and unwind.  Recently, I have also taken up bouldering.  The challenging nature requiring certain levels of problem-solving, and dedication massively appeal to me, and it is an excellent way to stay fit and healthy.</p>
